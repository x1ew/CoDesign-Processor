# CoDesign-Processor
This repository contains the VHDL code for implementing a custom processor with five instructions: LOAD, ADD, SUB, JNZ, and MUL. Additionally, an assembler designed specifically for this processor is provided to convert assembly code into binary code, which can then be stored in memory and executed by the processor.
